# Machine-Learning-Stanford
Completed Assignments of Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew NG
The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.
Topics include:
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
